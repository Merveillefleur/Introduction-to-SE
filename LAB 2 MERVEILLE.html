<h1>INTRODUCTION To Software Engineering</h1>
<h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
<p>Questions 1a)A complex real-time system whose requirements can be relatively easily identified and are stable.</p>
<p>Waterfall model as it is used for softwares which do not require change overtime,and for short processes.</p>
<p>Question 1b) A web- site for a local library requirements are vague and are likely to change in the future</p>
<pre>-----</pre>
<p>Question 1c) An order processing system with a web-site for a local business. Requirements are vague but stable (i.e. unlikely to change in the near future).</p>
<p> - Scrum: This is because the process is agile,consits of daily Sprint which helps identify new requirements,hinderances in the previous Sprint.
-2TUP: Iterations,incremental,driven by risk and usecases.</p>
<p>Qusetion1d)  Described the software process model that you have proposed in question 5(a) highlighting its strengths a/nd weaknesses.
</p>-Advantages *Before the next phase of development, each phase must be completed.
*
Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined.
*They should perform quality assurance test (Verification and Validation) before completing each stage.
*Elaborate documentation is done at every phase of the softwareâ€™s development cycle.</p>
<p>Disadvantage *Error can be fixed only during the phase
*It is not desirable for complex project where requirement changes frequently.
*
Small changes or errors that arise in the completed software may cause a lot of problems.
*Clients valuable feedback cannot be included with ongoing development phase.
*Documentation occupies a lot of time of developers and testers</p>
